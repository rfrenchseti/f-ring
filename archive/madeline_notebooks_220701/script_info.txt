RUNNING EWS:
regions/core:
	run_regions_create_ew.bash (has current radii being used, as well as 3 ranges used for the 3-region calculations)

iterative:
	run_iter_create_ew.bash (same as previous, but set up with the iterative radius values)

	notes: since currently running 10-km wide iterative slices, set up to output into 'iter_10' directory





TAU COMPUTATIONS:
running many values + storing in a CSV text file to plot:
	return_tau_regions.py (currently set up to store the tau values for all core widths in a csv textfile)
	return_tau_iter.py (same script, but set up for the iterative radii)
	
	notes:
	both of these currently are using the method of means to find the best-fit tau 
	(slopes method behaved strangely on iterative runs, need to look into more)

running a single value of tau + plotting on jupyter notebook:
	analyze_tau.ipynb (original, single-region version, uses means to calculate taus)
	analyze_tau_3_regions_fixed.ipynb (updated 3-region version, uses slopes, requires modified f_ring_util)
	analyze_tau_skirt_only.ipynb (version that just calculates the tau based on the skirt, currently uses means)

	notes: analyze_tau_3_regions_fixed.ipynb requires modified f_ring_util.py (see notes at end)
	additionally, takes in rounded radius boundaries, but subtracts/adds 1 to avoid overlap
	(e.g. ['139220', '140120', '140320', '141220'] produces inner, core, outer boundaries of
	139220-140119, 140120-140319, 140320-141220)
	(need to have files for these latter radii values to load in)
	





PLOTS (OTHER):
	plot_tau_core.ipynb (plots the tau value vs. core width stored in core return_tau csv file)

	plot_tau_iter.ipynb (plots the tau value vs. radius, using iter_10 return_tau csv file)

	notes: these scripts plot the tau values calculated using the means value





OTHER:
	mosaic_stack.py (outputs png image of the cropped, median-stacked, phase-normalized mosaics)

	MODIFIED f_ring_util.py (fit_hg_phase_function modified for multi-region dataframe setup)





NOTES (GENERAL):
directory setup:
	set up directories to account for different regions/types of runs, various radii, slice value used (only 0 for now):
	data -> dump_ew_csv -> region -> rinXXXXXX_routXXXXXX -> sliceX_ew_stats.csv
	(region directory names = core, iter_10, etc.)
		currently csv text files with tau values from return_tau....py also output into corresponding region directory
	(rin, rout XXXXXX values are values of radius for that run)
	(slice X refers to the slice value used, currently only using 0/whole-image slices)


f_ring_util modification:
	slightly modified fit_hg_phase_function() in f_ring_util to run analyze_tau_3_regions
	because of way tau is applied, needed to perform tau correction *before* submitting to function
	added parameter "multi_regions" (default False)
	if True, then takes column 'Multi Normal EW' rather than the 'Normal EW'
	('Multi Normal EW' is the 3-region combined + corrected values, while 'Normal EW' is the original full-image uncorrected ones for the dataframe in the 3_regions script)
	(not a very elegant fix, but this is just how I did it for the moment)
