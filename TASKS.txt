- Check Cassini calibration
  - Identify all observations that are common between 2012 paper and current
    mosaics.
  - Compare EWs and look for patterns.
  - Pick additional 3.6/4.0 CALIB files to compare and try to figure out why the
    calibrations are different and if there's any pattern.
  - Adjust old mosaics with conversion factors to see if they equal the current
    mosaics.
  - Look for other reasons the EWs may be different

- Compute Cassini phase curve
  - Once we understand phase curves, do we need to use the formalism from
    Appendix A to get good results?
    - If we need to use Appendix A, then implement Appendix A
      - Is the tau_equiv similar to what was found in the paper?
  - Repeat the above by looking only at the 15% percentile and 85% percentile
    values of the EW profile, as per the 2014 paper Section 2.3
    - Is there a difference in the phase curve, or its behavior over time,
      between the calm parts of the ring and the clumpy parts of the ring?

  - Look at phase curves using restricted radial ranges
    - Core only
    - Skirt only
    - Dust only

- Calculate phase-normalized EWs
  - Plot the ring brightness over time
    - To compute the brightness, divide each data point by the mean phase curve
      to get the divergence from the mean phase curve
    - Is there a pattern? Does the pattern correlate with Prometheus distance?
      (right side of Fig. 12)

- Voyager
  - Check Voyager calibration
    - Last time we used the A ring - do it again more carefully?
  - Correlate brightness with resolution - are low res observations bad?
  - How do these results compare against Voyager 1 and 2?

    that subset

    differences in inclination

  - Identify sequences of images that were taken with different filters and
    make colored mosaics.

- Width
  - Co-add groups of mosaics to look for changes in the width over time.
  - Find a way to quantify these changes.
  - Find a way to quantify the average width of individual mosaics.
  - Figure out why the width is changing.

- Clumps
  - Measure of "clumpiness"
    - Self-correlation of 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- degree sections of the ring with itself
    - Correlation of ring sections with same section at different times - over
      what time scale does the ring change?
  - Collect a database of major and minor EC events.
  - Plot the events on the observation timeline and compute statistical
    rate of occurrence.
  - Look for triggering moonlets in the mosaics leading up to those events.
  - Look at the true anomalies of the mosaics to see if they account for
    changes in clump shape, and see whether it's possible to get an orbit for
    any part of the clump (especially the triggering moonlet).
  - Look at the ansa-pair mosaics for events that cross the core, and see if
    it's possible to get an orbit.
  - Run simulations to see if it's possible to reproduce any clump events,
    especially those with really odd shapes.

- Strands
  - What causes the formation of strands? Are they collisional debris? Read
    the Kinematic Spiral paper.
  - Why would eccentricity gradients change and/or be discontinuous at strand
    boundaries?

- Eccentricity gradient - using manual slope measurement
  - Validate measurement of CS slopes determining gradient using a series of
    simulations that place Prometheus at different points of closest approach
    and measure the CS at different true anomalies.
  - Determine which part of the CS is best for measuring slopes - leading edge,
    trailing edge, something else?
  - Examine the effect of various non-linear gradients on CS shape and gradient
    prediction.
  - Examine the effect of pericenter gradients instead of eccentricity
    gradients.
  - Repeat the above using Pandora instead of Prometheus.
  - Perform simulations that include both Pandora and Prometheus.
  - Examine mosaics to determine if the different times and maybe different true
    anomalies of different generations of CS affect the gradient prediction
    results.
  - Carefully measure slopes of all CS in all mosaics and create a database.
  - Convert slopes to gradients and create a database.
  - Look for trends in the gradients:
    - Change of inner or outer over time
    - Correlation of change of inner vs outer

- Eccentricity gradient - using automated slope detection
  - Calculate whether a sufficiently high resolution (in longitude) mosaic can
    provide the granularity necessary for automatic slope detection using
    shift/stretch.
  - Create a high-resolution of one mosaic using only those images providing
    CS data.

    from manual measurements.
  - Find the ranges for CS in each mosaic.
  - Create high-resolution reprojected images and mosaics of each range/mosaic.
  - Run the shift/stretch algorithm on all high-resolution mosaics and create
    a database of results.

- Eccentricity gradient - analysis
  - Look for trends in the gradients:
    - Change of inner or outer over time
    - Correlation of change of inner vs outer
  - Create more simulations to try to derive an origin for the gradients.
  - Why would the gradients change at the dense core or at strands?





ARCHIVE

- For a limited period of time that has good longitude and phase coverage:
  - Fit a phase curve to the parameters:
    - HG parameters
    - N scale factors where each scale factor covers a section of the ring's
      longitude. For 1-degree slices there would be 360 scale factors.
    - The scale factors are the ring's brightness profile with the phase
      function removed.
    - How do the scale factors depend on relative brightness of that slice?
