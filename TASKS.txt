  - Mean equivalent width and its stddev
  - Mean normal equivalent width and its stddev
- For all observations that are common between 2012 paper and current mosaics
  - Compare published EW/STD with newly computed EW/STD
    - Plot old and new EW with errors bars on a graph
    - Compare ratios of old and new EW - are they the same for all observations?
- Compare the EW for the _1 and _2 versions
  - Find the overlapping co-rotating longitudes and restrict both mosaics to
    that subset
  - Recompute the EW/STD for each
  - Compare
- Derive the phase curve for all observations using the methodology in the 2012
  paper (log-cubic)  [Fig. 7]
  - Figure out how to handle the big bright event
    - Start by just removing those observations entirely
    - Perhaps look at restricting which longitudes are used in those
      observations
  - Plot the resulting phase curves for the various options
- Look for scatter around the phase curve
  - Are the readings consistent with phase or is there scatter?
  - If you look at the mosaics can you figure out why there is scatter?
    - In other words, if a result looks too bright for its phase, can you
      identify a dynamic reason in the mosaic why this is reasonable, like
      a big clump?
  - If you identify points (e.g. color code) with emission angle or incidence
    angle is there a pattern to the scatter?
  - Do we need to use the formalism from Appendix A to get good results?
- If we need to use Appendix A, then implement Appendix A
  - Is the tau_equiv similar to what was found in the paper?
- How do these results compare against Voyager 1 and 2?
- Lock in the shape of the phase curve and fit it to subsets of the data, such
  as by year or multiple years or other relevant grouping, to see if there is
  any change over time  [Fig. 8]
  - Plot the overlapping phase curves
  - Compute the ratio between the phase curves
- Instead of plotting a phase curve, plot the ring brightness over time
  - To compute the brightness, divide each data point by the mean phase curve
    to get the divergence from the mean phase curve
  - Is there a pattern? Does the pattern correlate with Prometheus distance?
    (right side of Fig. 12)
- Repeat the above by looking only at the 15% percentile and 85% percentile
  values of the EW profile, as per the 2014 paper Section 2.3
  - Is there a difference in the phase curve, or its behavior over time,
    between the calm parts of the ring and the clumpy parts of the ring?
