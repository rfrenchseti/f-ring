- Voyager: Correlate brightness with resolution - are low res observations bad?
- For a limited period of time that has good longitude and phase coverage:
  - Fit a phase curve to the parameters:
    - HG parameters
    - N scale factors where each scale factor covers a section of the ring's
      longitude. For 1-degree slices there would be 360 scale factors.
    - The scale factors are the ring's brightness profile with the phase
      function removed.
    - How do the scale factors depend on relative brightness of that slice?
- Measure of "clumpiness"
  - Self-correlation of 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- degree sections of the ring with itself
  - Correlation of ring sections with same section at different times - over
    what time scale does the ring change?

- Check our reprojection code
  - Look for sensitivity to zoom size
  - Compare to EW when not reprojecting at all
- Check Cassini calibration
  - For all observations that are common between 2012 paper and current mosaics
  - Pick additional 3.6/4.0 CALIB files to compare and try to figure out why the
    calibrations are different and if there's any pattern.
  - Look for other reasons the EWs may be different
- Check Voyager calibration
  - Last time we used the A ring - do it again more carefully?
- Compare the the _1 and _2 versions
  - Find the overlapping co-rotating longitudes and restrict both mosaics to
    that subset
  - Recompute the EW+/-STD for each and compare
  - Visually compare the two versions and categorize differences
  - Look for clumps that cross the core and correlate with large clumps or dust jets
- Look for shadows around the equinox that indicate tall clumps or differences in
  inclination
  - Correlate with large clumps or dust jets
- Look at phase curves using restricted radial ranges
  - Core only
  - Skirt only
  - Dust only
- Once we understand phase curves, do we need to use the formalism from Appendix A to
  get good results?
  - If we need to use Appendix A, then implement Appendix A
    - Is the tau_equiv similar to what was found in the paper?
- How do these results compare against Voyager 1 and 2?
- Plot the ring brightness over time
  - To compute the brightness, divide each data point by the mean phase curve
    to get the divergence from the mean phase curve
  - Is there a pattern? Does the pattern correlate with Prometheus distance?
    (right side of Fig. 12)
- Repeat the above by looking only at the 15% percentile and 85% percentile
  values of the EW profile, as per the 2014 paper Section 2.3
  - Is there a difference in the phase curve, or its behavior over time,
    between the calm parts of the ring and the clumpy parts of the ring?
- Clumps!
- Color slope using reprojection
